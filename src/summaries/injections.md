This work creates virtual injection videos from 4D-Flow datasets.  By integrating along the velocity data, the motion of particles are simulated with a set of constraints on fluid dynamics and our knowledge of the anatomy.  This allows for injections to be simulated, as well as non-physiological effects such as "reverse" injections, where the particles are reversed to see where they come from.
