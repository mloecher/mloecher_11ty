This project utilized gradient waveform optimization and advanced RF pulse design to shorten the acquisition time of a 4D-flow acquisition by up to 35%.  A peripheral nerve stimulation function is used as an inequality constraint which enables the hardware to use a dynamic slew rate that adjusts itself to the current PNS.
